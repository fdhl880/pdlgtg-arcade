# Native UI assets

The runtime uses the original game's Latin letter shapes, counters and character portraits from the included runtime pack. The prepared assets are included in `assets/mario-kart/ui/`; missing files use the fallback portraits and system font. Rebuilding them from source sheets is optional.

Download the font archive and run:

```sh
python3 games/mario-kart/pipeline/prepare-ui-font.py /path/to/69863.zip
```

Requires Pillow, numpy, opencv-python and fonttools. The script traces the white Latin glyph contours at the supplied raster resolution into local WOFF files. These preserve the supplied glyph shapes but are **not** the original commercial font binary, kerning or full multilingual character set. The countdown, position and FINISH display art remains the existing vector approximation of the bespoke race artwork.

Save the unmodified character sprite sheet as `assets/mario-kart/ui/driver-icons.png`. `loadSourcePortraits()` crops the eight relevant cells in the browser and shares the resulting sprites between the menu, map and standings. Source sheets are never modified. Nintendo artwork remains Nintendo's; uploader attribution above.
